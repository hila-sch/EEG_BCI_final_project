During this experiment, you will be watching three short video lectures on different topics.
For some of the videos, you will receive feedback on your sustained attention level. 
Before and after each lecture, you will be asked to answer questions about the content of the lecture. 
If you are unsure of an answer, it's better to leave the question blank than to guess.
If you experience any discomfort, you can pause the video and inform the experimenter.
