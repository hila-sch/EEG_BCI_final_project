# EEG-based Brain Computer Interface for the Modulation of Sustained Attnetion in Learning

### Final MSc project, Computational Cognitive Science, University of Groningen

This repository contains the code accompaying the developement of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that provides real-time feedback to participants in an online-learning setting. This is the abstract of the theiss:

Sustained attention during educational lectures is essential for effective learning. Although prior studies have demonstrated the efficacy of real-time feedback on engagement for improving self-regulation of attention, its specific application in educational contexts, especially when directed at learners themselves, remains underexplored. This thesis investigates the influence of real-time attention feedback, utilizing an EEG-based Engagement Index (EI), on both sustained attention and learning outcomes in the context of online lectures. In this study, a novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system was developed to provide real-time feedback to participants while they watched recorded educational lectures. Using a within-participant design, the participants watched three videos, with each video presenting one of three conditions: feedback, no feedback, and false feedback. Contrary to initial expectations, the analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences in learning outcomes or sustained attention between these conditions. This unexpected result was influenced by various factors, including the limited sample size, the diverse nature of individual attention patterns, artifacts in the EEG signal, and the choice of feedback design and lecture content. To address these challenges and pave the way for future research, we propose examining alternative feedback modalities, enhancing artifact cleaning techniques, and exploring diverse participant groups and environments, including children, individuals with ADHD, and professionals in various work settings. Thus, while our study did not reveal the anticipated improvements in learning and sustained attention, it serves as a foundational step for future investigations aimed at enhancing attention in online educational settings.

In experiment 2, this work was extended. I compared visual feedback to haptic feedback.
